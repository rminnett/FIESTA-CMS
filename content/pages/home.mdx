        title: Introduction
        text: >
          In our **[OSU Argon Geochronology Lab](/)** we employ the <Superscript
          value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar geochronology method to
          determine how hotspots evolve and interact with the lithosphere, in
          quantifying rates at which large igneous provinces are constructed, in
          deciphering the early history of the Earth and Moon, in tracking
          transport pathways of terrigenous sediments from rivers to deep-sea
          sediments, and more.

          Our laboratory is equipped with two noble gas mass spectrometers for
          carrying out <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar
          age determinations. We have two brand-new Thermo Scientific ARGUS VI
          multi-collector (installed in 2012 and 2015) with five fixed Faraday
          detectors and one ion-counting CuBe electron multiplier.

        title: Publications
        text: >
          Since 1977 investigators, students and post-docs in our laboratory
          have produced <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39"
          />Ar age data that appeared in more than 195 peer-reviewed
          publications and in 31 Senior, MSc and PhD theses. This long list of
          papers could not have been possible without the more than 100 visitors
          over the last decades and our numerous national and international
          collaborators.
